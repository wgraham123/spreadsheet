# Goals:
Minimal effort to make it cross platform, just getting it to work to start with.

Extremely simple GUI. Sheet of cells, maybe 100x100 to start. Should have the letters across and the numbers down. No pages, one sheet per file, no start menu or anything, just saving for now. Gonna look kinda like this, with Cmd+S to save, buttons to close or minimise.

User will click on a cell to overwrite it, or can double click to append to it (mini text editor?).
User can do extremely basic mathematical operations (+, -, *, /) using references like =A1*A2
